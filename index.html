                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">As we know that Malnutrition is one of the greatest ever crisis
                    experienced all over the world. Especially among the children community, this problem is rising at a
                    sharp speed every year specially in the past and the current year. For that many people are dying
                    all over the world each year. Approximately 3.1 million children die each year due to malnutrition
                    as reported by UNICEF in the year 2018. In India also it is a very serious problem. Many people are
                    starving to death due to lack of food and proper nutrition in India too. So by looking this
                    situtions across India, our government has launched a mission known as 'Aahar Kranti' on April 13,
                    2021. So I have built this website to create awarness among the people about need for proper
                    nutrition and to promote the government iniciative 'Aahar Kranti' mission.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">On 13 April 2021, Union Minister for Science and Technology, Earth
                    Sciences and Health and Family Welfare, Dr. Harsh Vardhan launched 'Aahaar Kranti' Mission, a
                    join-initiative of Vijnana Bharati (Vibha), ‘Global Indian Scientists and Technocrats’ Forum (GIST),
                    Vigyan Prasar, and Pravasi Bharatiya Academic and Scientific Sampark (PRABHASS). Also, a monthly
                    newsletter 'Aahaar Kranti', both in Hindi and English has also been launched and will be published
                    by Vigyan Prasar.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for a
                    nutritionally balanced diet as a healthy body will be able to fight the novel virus with greater
                    resilience. The initiative aims at spreading awareness about a nutritious diet to every citizen of
                    the country. It has been launched with the motto of ‘Uttam Aahaar- Uttam Vichaar’ or `Good Diet-Good
                    Cognition’. It is designed to address the particular problem being faced by India and the world--
                    hunger and diseases in abundance.
                    <br><br>
                    It will be a model for the entire world to look upon. As per several studies, India produces twice
                    the amount of calories that it consumes. Despite this, many in the country are malnourished. The
                    root cause behind this strange phenomenon is the lack of nutritional awareness.
